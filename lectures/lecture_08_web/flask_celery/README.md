## Set up.

You'll maybe want to create a new environment, then:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the example.

### 1. Set up redis.
First off, make sure to have `redis` running on `0.0.0.0:6379`. If you're using docker you may want to:

```bash
docker run --name some-redis -d redis
```

### 2. Start a celery worker.
You'll need a worker to get things done, run the following command in a separate terminal tab:

```bash
celery worker -A run.celery --loglevel=info --pool=solo
```

### 3. Start the app.

Open a new terminal tab and start the app:

```bash
python run.py
```
